title: Quick Start
description: Try Colloquium locally to explore the editorial workflow.
---

This guide helps you run Colloquium on your own computer to explore the editorial workflow, test the conversation system, and see how bots work. This is for evaluation — for production deployment, see the [deployment guide](/deployment/overview).

## Prerequisites

You'll need some technical tools installed. If you're not comfortable with command-line tools, ask a colleague from your IT department to help set this up.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colloquium-press/colloquium.git
cd colloquium
npm install
```

## Start services

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and MailHog
npm run docker:up

# Run database migrations and seed with sample data
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# Start the development servers
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:4000
- **MailHog** (email testing): http://localhost:8025
- **Prisma Studio** (database UI): http://localhost:5555

## Log in

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Enter any of the seeded user emails (check the seed data or Prisma Studio)
4. Open MailHog at http://localhost:8025 to find the magic link email
5. Click the magic link to complete authentication

## Explore the workflow

With the local instance running, try the complete editorial cycle:

- **Submit a manuscript** — upload a PDF or Markdown file to see the author experience
- **Assign reviewers** — use `@editorial-bot invite-reviewer @username` in a conversation
- **Try the review process** — switch between user accounts to see different privacy levels
- **Check references** — use `@reference-bot check` to validate citations
- **Make a decision** — use `@editorial-bot accept` or `@editorial-bot request-revision`

The sample data includes several users with different roles, so you can experience the platform from multiple perspectives.

## Next steps

- [First Submission](/getting-started/first-submission) — detailed walkthrough of the submission workflow
- [Journal Administration](/guides/journal-administration) — configure your journal settings
- [Deployment](/deployment/overview) — deploy to production infrastructure

## Production deployment

For a production instance, use the CLI tool instead:

```bash
npx create-colloquium-journal init "My Journal" \
  --slug "my-journal" \
  --domain "journal.example.com" \
  --admin-email "editor@example.com" \
  --deployment docker
```

See the [deployment guide](/deployment/overview) for full instructions.
