description: Get a local Colloquium instance running for evaluation.
---

This guide gets a Colloquium instance running on your local machine using Docker Compose. You'll have a fully functional journal platform in a few commands.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colloquium-press/colloquium.git
cd colloquium
npm install
```

## Start services

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and MailHog
npm run docker:up

# Run database migrations and seed with sample data
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# Start the development servers
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:4000
- **MailHog** (email testing): http://localhost:8025
- **Prisma Studio** (database UI): http://localhost:5555

## Log in

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Enter any of the seeded user emails (check the seed data or Prisma Studio)
4. Open MailHog at http://localhost:8025 to find the magic link email
5. Click the magic link to complete authentication

## Explore

With the dev instance running, you can:

- **Submit a manuscript** — upload a PDF or Markdown file as an author
- **View conversations** — see the conversational review interface
- **Try bot commands** — @mention bots in a conversation thread
- **Admin settings** — configure journal settings, install bots
- **Prisma Studio** — browse the database at http://localhost:5555

## Next steps

- [First Submission](/getting-started/first-submission) — detailed walkthrough of the submission workflow
- [Journal Administration](/guides/journal-administration) — configure your journal settings
- [Deployment](/deployment/overview) — deploy to production infrastructure

## Production deployment

For a production instance, use the CLI tool instead:

```bash
npx create-colloquium-journal init "My Journal" \
  --slug "my-journal" \
  --domain "journal.example.com" \
  --admin-email "editor@example.com" \
  --deployment docker
```

See the [deployment guide](/deployment/overview) for full instructions.
