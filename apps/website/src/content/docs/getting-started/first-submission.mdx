description: Walk through submitting and reviewing a manuscript end-to-end.
---

This guide walks through the complete manuscript lifecycle — from submission to editorial decision — using a running Colloquium instance.

## Submit a manuscript

1. Log in as an author (or any user with submission privileges)
2. Navigate to the submission page
3. Fill in the manuscript metadata:
   - **Title** — the manuscript title
   - **Abstract** — a brief summary
   - **Keywords** — for categorization and discovery
4. Upload the manuscript file (PDF, LaTeX, Word, or Markdown)
5. Optionally add co-authors by email
6. Submit

The manuscript status is now **SUBMITTED** and a conversation thread is automatically created.

## Editor screening

1. Log in as an editor (EDITOR_IN_CHIEF or ACTION_EDITOR role)
2. Open the submissions dashboard
3. View the new manuscript and its associated conversation
4. In the editorial conversation, you can use the editorial bot:

```
@editorial-bot assign-editor @action-editor-username
```

The action editor is now assigned and can manage the review process.

## Invite reviewers

In the review conversation thread:

```
@editorial-bot invite-reviewer @reviewer-username deadline:2025-04-01
```

The reviewer receives an invitation email with a response link. They can accept or decline.

## Review process

Once a reviewer accepts:

1. They gain access to the manuscript files and the review conversation
2. They can post messages in the conversation with their feedback
3. They can use the reviewer checklist bot for structured evaluation:

```
@reviewer-checklist-bot start
```

4. When ready, they submit their formal review with:
   - Review content (detailed feedback)
   - Recommendation (Accept, Minor Revision, Major Revision, Reject)
   - Numerical score (1-10)
   - Optional confidential comments for editors only

## Editorial decision

After reviews are collected, the editor makes a decision. In the conversation:

```
@editorial-bot request-revision
```

Or:

```
@editorial-bot accept
```

The manuscript status transitions accordingly, and the author is notified.

## Revision cycle

If revisions are requested:

1. The author uploads a revised manuscript
2. The status changes to **REVISED**
3. The editor can invite the same or new reviewers for re-review
4. The process repeats until a final decision is reached

## Publication

When a manuscript is accepted:

1. The editor (or editorial bot) transitions the status to **ACCEPTED**
2. The markdown renderer bot can format the manuscript:

```
@markdown-renderer-bot render --engine typst --template academic-standard
```

3. The formatted output is stored as a RENDERED file
4. When ready, the status transitions to **PUBLISHED**
5. Assets are copied to static hosting for public access

## What's happening behind the scenes

- **Bot mentions** trigger asynchronous jobs via the Redis/Bull queue
- **SSE** broadcasts new messages to connected participants in real-time
- **Privacy controls** ensure each participant only sees messages appropriate to their role
- **File storage** organizes everything per-manuscript with type categorization
- **Audit trail** records all status transitions and bot executions
