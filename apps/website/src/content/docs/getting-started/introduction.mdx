description: What Colloquium is, who it's for, and how it works.

Colloquium is an open-source platform for running academic journals. It provides manuscript submission, conversational peer review, automated editorial workflows, and a publishing pipeline — all in a single self-hosted application.

## Who is Colloquium for?

- **Academic editors** who want to run a journal without vendor lock-in or expensive contracts
- **Institutions** that want to give researchers publishing independence with data sovereignty
- **Communities** exploring alternative peer review models (open review, collaborative review, post-publication review)
- **Developers** interested in building automation for scholarly workflows

## Key concepts

### Conversational review

Instead of emailing PDFs back and forth, all review communication happens in structured conversation threads. Each conversation has a privacy level that determines who can see it:

- **Editorial** — editors only
- **Review** — editors + assigned reviewers
- **Semi-Public** — editors, reviewers, and authors
- **Public** — open to everyone
- **Author-Only** — co-authors discussing privately

Individual messages can have their own privacy level too, so an editor can post a public comment and a private note in the same thread.

### Bot automation

Bots are triggered by @mentions in conversations. Type `@reference-bot check` and the reference bot will extract DOIs from the manuscript, validate them against CrossRef, and report back. Type `@editorial-bot invite-reviewer @jane.doe` to send a review invitation.

Four bots are included:
- **@editorial-bot** — reviewer management, status transitions, deadline tracking
- **@markdown-renderer-bot** — manuscript formatting and PDF generation
- **@reference-bot** — DOI validation and citation checking
- **@reviewer-checklist-bot** — structured evaluation forms

You can also [build your own bots](/bots/introduction) with the TypeScript SDK.

### Self-hosted instances

Each journal runs as its own isolated instance with its own database, file storage, and application containers. You deploy on your own infrastructure using Docker, a cloud platform, or Kubernetes. The `create-colloquium-journal` CLI tool generates everything you need.

## Architecture overview

```
apps/
├── web/       # Next.js 14 frontend
├── api/       # Express.js backend
packages/
├── database/  # Prisma schema + PostgreSQL
├── bots/      # Bot framework core
├── types/     # Shared TypeScript types
└── ...        # Bot packages, auth, UI components
```

The stack is TypeScript throughout, with PostgreSQL for the database, Redis for the job queue and real-time events, and Prisma for type-safe database access.
