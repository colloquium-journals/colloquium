description: What Colloquium is, who it's for, and how it works.

Colloquium is an open-source platform for running academic journals. It provides manuscript submission, conversational peer review, automated editorial workflows, and a publishing pipeline — all in a single self-hosted application.

## Who is Colloquium for?

- **Academic editors** who want to run a journal without vendor lock-in or expensive contracts
- **Institutions** that want to give researchers publishing independence with data sovereignty
- **Communities** exploring alternative peer review models (open review, collaborative review, post-publication review)
- **Developers** interested in building automation for scholarly workflows

## Key concepts

### Conversational review

Instead of emailing PDFs back and forth, all review communication happens in structured conversation threads. Each conversation has a privacy level that determines who can see it:

- **Editorial** — editors only
- **Review** — editors + assigned reviewers
- **Semi-Public** — editors, reviewers, and authors
- **Public** — open to everyone
- **Author-Only** — co-authors discussing privately

Individual messages can have their own privacy level too, so an editor can post a public comment and a private note in the same thread.

### Automated assistance

Bots help with routine tasks. @mention them in any conversation:

- **@editorial-bot** — manage the review process: invite reviewers, track deadlines, record decisions
- **@reference-bot** — check that citations are valid and complete
- **@markdown-renderer-bot** — format manuscripts for publication
- **@reviewer-checklist-bot** — guide reviewers through structured evaluation criteria

Type `@reference-bot check` and the bot will scan the manuscript, find all DOIs, and verify each one against CrossRef — reporting any that are invalid or missing metadata.

Journals can also add custom bots for specialized workflows. See the [bot development guide](/bots/introduction) for details.

### Independent journals

Each journal runs as its own separate installation. Your journal's data — manuscripts, reviews, user accounts — stays completely isolated from other journals. This means:

- **Data sovereignty** — your institution controls where data is stored
- **Customization** — configure workflows, templates, and bots for your specific needs
- **Independence** — your journal isn't affected by other journals or platform-wide changes

Deployment options range from one-click cloud setups to on-premises installation.

## What makes Colloquium different

**Conversations, not email chains.** Every interaction happens in context. Editors, reviewers, and authors discuss manuscripts in persistent threads with full history. No more forwarding PDFs or losing track of who said what.

**Flexible privacy models.** Run traditional double-blind review, open peer review, or anything in between. Privacy controls work at the conversation level and the individual message level.

**Automation that helps, not hinders.** Bots handle mechanical tasks — validating references, formatting for publication, generating reviewer checklists — so humans can focus on scholarly judgment.

**Your data, your infrastructure.** Each journal runs on its own instance. Deploy on your university servers, a cloud provider, or your own hardware. No data sharing across journals, no platform lock-in.
