description: Overview of the Colloquium bot framework and what bots can do.
---

Bots are plugins that automate editorial workflows in Colloquium. They respond to @mentions in conversations, processing commands asynchronously and posting results back to the thread.

## What bots can do

- **Check references** — validate DOIs and citations against external APIs
- **Format manuscripts** — convert source files to publication-ready output
- **Manage workflow** — assign editors, invite reviewers, transition manuscript status
- **Generate checklists** — produce structured evaluation forms for reviewers
- **Anything else** — the framework is extensible for any automation need

## How bots work

```
User posts: "@reference-bot check"
      ↓
System detects @mention
      ↓
Job queued in Redis/Bull
      ↓
Worker picks up job (3 concurrent workers)
      ↓
Bot processes command with full context
      ↓
Bot posts response as new message
      ↓
SSE broadcasts to participants
```

Bots are never blocking — the user posts their message and continues working. The bot's response appears asynchronously.

## Bot interface

Every bot implements a standard interface:

```typescript
interface BotDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  version: string;
  commands: BotCommand[];
  permissions: BotPermission[];
  defaultConfig: Record<string, unknown>;
}

interface BotCommand {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  handler: (context: BotContext) => Promise<BotResponse>;
}
```

## Execution context

When a bot command runs, it receives rich context:

```typescript
interface BotContext {
  command: string;
  args: string[];
  manuscriptId: string;
  conversationId: string;
  messageId: string;
  userId: string;
  userRole: string;
  config: Record<string, unknown>;
  apiToken: string; // For authenticated API calls
}
```

## Security model

- Bots authenticate with scoped service tokens (`X-Bot-Token` header)
- Permissions are declared in the bot definition and approved at install time
- Bots access data through API endpoints, not direct database queries
- Bot failures are isolated — they don't crash the platform
- Every execution is logged with status, duration, and output
