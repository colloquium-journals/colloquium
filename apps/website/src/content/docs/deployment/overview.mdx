title: Deployment Overview
description: Options for deploying your Colloquium journal instance to production.
---

Colloquium is designed for self-hosted deployment. Each journal runs as its own isolated instance with a separate database, file storage, and application containers.

## Deployment options

| Method | Best for | Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|
| [Docker Compose](/deployment/docker-compose) | Small journals, evaluation | Low |
| [Cloud platforms](/deployment/cloud-platforms) (Railway, Fly.io, Render) | Hands-off hosting | Low |
| AWS / GCP / Azure | Enterprise, institutional | Medium |
| Kubernetes | Large-scale, multi-journal | High |

## Instance generator

The `create-colloquium-journal` CLI generates a complete deployment package for your chosen target:

```bash
npx create-colloquium-journal init "My Journal" \
  --slug "my-journal" \
  --domain "journal.example.com" \
  --admin-email "editor@example.com" \
  --deployment docker
```

This produces a directory with all configuration files, scripts, and documentation needed to deploy.

## System requirements

### Minimum (small journal, fewer than 100 manuscripts)

- 2 CPU cores
- 4 GB RAM
- 20 GB storage
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 7+
- Node.js 18+

### Recommended (active journal)

- 4 CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 100 GB storage
- Managed PostgreSQL with backups
- Managed Redis
- CDN for published assets

## Architecture components

Every Colloquium instance consists of:

| Component | Purpose | Port |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Web (Next.js) | Frontend application | 3000 |
| API (Express) | Backend API server | 4000 |
| PostgreSQL | Primary database | 5432 |
| Redis | Job queue + real-time events | 6379 |
| File storage | Manuscript files | - |

For production, add:
- **Reverse proxy** (Nginx, Caddy) for SSL termination and routing
- **Backup system** for database and file storage
- **Monitoring** for health checks and alerting

## Environment variables

Core configuration for any deployment:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | Yes | Redis connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for JWT token signing |
| `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET` | Yes | Secret for magic link generation |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Yes | Public URL of the frontend |
| `API_URL` | Yes | Public URL of the API |
| `SMTP_HOST` | Yes | Email server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Yes | Email server port |
| `SMTP_USER` | - | Email server username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | - | Email server password |

## SSL / TLS

All production deployments should use HTTPS. Options:
- **Let's Encrypt** with Certbot (Docker deployments)
- **Cloud provider certificates** (AWS ACM, GCP managed certs)
- **Cloudflare** proxy with automatic SSL

## DNS configuration

Point your domain to your deployment:

```
journal.example.com     A     → your-server-ip
```

Or with a cloud provider:

```
journal.example.com     CNAME → your-app.fly.dev
```

- [Docker Compose](/deployment/docker-compose) — simplest deployment path
- [Cloud Platforms](/deployment/cloud-platforms) — zero-config cloud deployment
- [Upgrading](/deployment/upgrading) — keeping your instance up to date
