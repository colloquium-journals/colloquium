description: Magic link authentication, ORCID integration, and user profiles.
---

Colloquium uses passwordless authentication via magic links — secure one-time-use URLs sent to the user's email address.

## Magic link flow

1. User enters their email address on the login page
2. The system generates a secure token and sends an email containing a login link
3. User clicks the link in their email
4. The token is verified and a JWT session is created
5. The user is redirected to the application

### Security properties

- Tokens are single-use and expire after a configurable period
- JWT sessions support automatic renewal
- No passwords to compromise, phish, or forget
- Multi-device support through independent sessions

## ORCID integration

[ORCID](https://orcid.org) provides persistent digital identifiers for researchers. Colloquium integrates with ORCID for identity verification.

### Current implementation

Users can add their ORCID iD to their profile. The system validates the format and verifies it against the ORCID public API.

### Planned: Full OAuth

Full ORCID OAuth 2.0 integration is on the roadmap, providing cryptographic proof of identity ownership rather than self-reported verification.

## User profiles

### Required fields

- **Email** — used for authentication and notifications
- **Name** — displayed in conversations and assignments

### Optional fields

- **Username** — 3-30 characters, lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens. Used for @mentions.
- **Bio** — brief professional biography
- **Affiliation** — institutional affiliation
- **Website** — personal or institutional URL
- **ORCID** — researcher identifier

### Profile completion

First-time users are prompted to complete their profile after initial authentication. Only email and name are required; all other fields are optional.

## Roles

Users are assigned a global role that determines their platform-wide permissions:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ADMIN | Full system access |
| EDITOR_IN_CHIEF | All editorial functions |
| ACTION_EDITOR | Manage assigned manuscripts |
| USER | Submit manuscripts, review when assigned |
| BOT | Service account for bot authentication |

Roles are assigned by administrators through the admin settings panel.

## Bot authentication

Bots authenticate using service tokens passed in the `X-Bot-Token` HTTP header. Bot tokens are generated during bot installation and provide scoped access to the API based on the bot's declared permissions.

## Environment variables

Configure authentication behavior with these environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWT tokens |
| `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET` | Secret for magic link token generation |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | URL for constructing magic link redirects |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server for sending login emails |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP password |
