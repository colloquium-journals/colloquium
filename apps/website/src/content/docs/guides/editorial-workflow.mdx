description: Managing manuscripts from submission through publication.

This guide covers the editor's perspective on managing manuscripts through the review process.

## Submission intake

When a manuscript is submitted, it appears in the submissions dashboard with status **SUBMITTED**. A conversation thread is automatically created.

### Initial screening

Editors can review the submission for:
- Completeness (all required files present)
- Scope (appropriate for the journal)
- Format compliance (acceptable file types)

The reference bot can be used for initial checks:

```
@reference-bot check
```

This extracts DOIs and validates them, giving a quick quality signal.

## Editor assignment

Assign an action editor to manage the review:

```
@editorial-bot assign-editor @username
```

The assigned editor becomes responsible for the manuscript and gains full editorial access to all conversation threads.

## Reviewer management

### Inviting reviewers

```
@editorial-bot invite-reviewer @username deadline:2025-04-01
```

Optional parameters:
- `deadline` — response deadline (ISO date format)
- A custom message can be included in the invitation

### Tracking responses

The reviewer management panel shows:
- **PENDING** — invitation sent, awaiting response
- **ACCEPTED** — reviewer agreed, review in progress
- **DECLINED** — reviewer declined the invitation
- **IN_PROGRESS** — reviewer is actively working
- **COMPLETED** — review submitted

### Reviewer search

Search for potential reviewers by:
- Name, email, or affiliation
- Expertise tags (when configured)
- Automatic exclusion of manuscript authors (conflict prevention)

## Review collection

Reviews include:
- **Content** — detailed feedback (minimum 10 characters)
- **Recommendation** — ACCEPT, MINOR_REVISION, MAJOR_REVISION, or REJECT
- **Score** — numerical rating (1-10)
- **Confidential comments** — visible only to editors
- **Attachments** — annotated manuscripts or supplementary files

## Making decisions

### Status transitions

| From | To | Meaning |
|------|-----|---------|
| SUBMITTED | UNDER_REVIEW | Review process started |
| UNDER_REVIEW | REVISION_REQUESTED | Author needs to revise |
| UNDER_REVIEW | ACCEPTED | Manuscript accepted |
| UNDER_REVIEW | REJECTED | Manuscript rejected |
| REVISION_REQUESTED | REVISED | Author submitted revision |
| REVISED | UNDER_REVIEW | Re-review started |
| ACCEPTED | PUBLISHED | Article published |

### Using the editorial bot

```
@editorial-bot accept
@editorial-bot reject
@editorial-bot request-revision
```

Each command transitions the manuscript status and notifies relevant parties.

## Revision cycles

When revisions are requested:

1. Author receives notification
2. Author uploads revised manuscript
3. Status changes to REVISED
4. Editor decides whether to send for re-review or make a decision
5. Process repeats as needed

## Publication

When a manuscript is accepted and ready for publication:

1. Use the markdown renderer for final formatting
2. Review the formatted output
3. Transition to PUBLISHED
4. Assets are automatically moved to static hosting
