description: Configure journal settings, manage bots, and set up your editorial team.
---

The admin settings panel lets you configure every aspect of your journal — from basic metadata to bot installations and user roles.

## Accessing admin settings

Navigate to `/admin/settings` in your journal instance. You need the **ADMIN** or **EDITOR_IN_CHIEF** role.

## Journal metadata

Configure the basic identity of your journal:

- **Name** — displayed in the header, emails, and metadata
- **Description** — brief description for SEO and about pages
- **Logo** — upload a logo image for branding

## Bot management

### Installing bots

1. Open the Bots section in admin settings
2. Browse available bots
3. Click "Install" to add a bot to your journal
4. Configure bot-specific settings via the YAML editor

### Bot configuration

Each bot has a YAML configuration file that controls its behavior. The admin panel provides a syntax-highlighted editor with the bot's default configuration as a starting point.

Example editorial bot configuration:

```yaml
# Default review deadline (days from invitation)
defaultDeadline: 21

# Reminder intervals (days before deadline)
reminders:
  - 7
  - 3
  - 1
```

### Bot file uploads

Some bots accept file uploads for templates or reference data. Use the file upload section in each bot's settings panel.

## User role management

### Available roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **ADMIN** | Full system access, user management, settings |
| **EDITOR_IN_CHIEF** | All editorial functions, bot management |
| **ACTION_EDITOR** | Assigned manuscript management, reviewer invitations |
| **USER** | Submission, reviewing (when assigned) |

### Assigning roles

1. Navigate to user management in admin settings
2. Search for the user by name or email
3. Select the appropriate role
4. Save changes

Role changes take effect immediately for new actions. Existing assignments are preserved.

## Content management

### About pages

Colloquium supports Markdown-based about pages with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: About This Journal
icon: info-circle
order: 1
visible: true
---

Your journal's about content here...
```

Pages are ordered by the `order` field and can be hidden with `visible: false`.

### Editorial board

The about section can automatically generate an editorial board page from user data, showing editors with their affiliations and roles.

## Submission guidelines

Configure the submission guidelines that authors see when submitting manuscripts. Supports Markdown formatting.

## Supported formats

The format registry controls which file types your journal accepts for submission. By default, PDF, LaTeX, Word, and Markdown are enabled. You can restrict or expand this list.
