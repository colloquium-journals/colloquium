- Justification for animal use and number of subjects

**3Rs Principle Implementation**
- **Replacement**: Use alternatives to animals when possible
- **Reduction**: Minimize number of animals used
- **Refinement**: Minimize pain, distress, and harm

### Environmental and Safety Considerations

**Environmental Impact**
- Consider environmental implications of research
- Proper waste disposal and contamination prevention
- Assessment of ecological impact for field studies
- Sustainable research practices

**Laboratory Safety**
- Compliance with institutional safety protocols
- Proper handling of hazardous materials
- Training documentation for personnel
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Publication Ethics

### Authorship

**Authorship Criteria**
All authors must meet these four criteria:
1. Substantial contribution to conception, design, analysis, or interpretation
2. Drafting or critical revision of intellectual content
3. Final approval of version to be published
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work

**Authorship Order**
- First author: Primary contributor to research and writing
- Corresponding author: Takes responsibility for communication
- Senior/last author: Typically the principal investigator
- Order should reflect relative contributions

**Inappropriate Authorship Practices**
- **Guest authorship**: Including authors who don't meet criteria
- **Ghost authorship**: Excluding qualifying contributors
- **Gift authorship**: Adding authors for non-scientific reasons
- **Authorship trading**: Reciprocal authorship arrangements

### Originality and Plagiarism

- Clearly distinguish from previous work by same authors
- Appropriate citation of all sources and influences
- Disclosure of any previous presentation or publication

**Plagiarism Prevention**
- Proper attribution of all sources and ideas
- Clear marking of direct quotations
- Paraphrasing with appropriate citation

- Limited reuse of authors' own previous text is acceptable
- Must be clearly identified and cited
- Should not constitute majority of manuscript
- Journal policies on self-citation must be followed

### Data and Materials

**Data Integrity**
